# Diskussions when developing

### Python mode flavors handling

Major flavors known which should receive a
names-component to discern

Shipped GNU Python mode - gnu
Shipped XEmacs mode     - xpm
XEmacs branch           - xem
Fabian E Gallina        - fg
Dave Love               - dl
Python-mode.el          - pme
Python-components-mode  - pcm
PDEE modularized        - pdem

the PDEE default        - pdee

### Costum group

Probably PDEE should get his own group

### Github or Launchpad or Others? - suitability

Still exploring Github... will it be the best we can have?

missing a little bit the email-notifications of commits Launchpad provides
