# Diskussions when developing

### Costum group

Probably PDEE should get his own group

### Github or Launchpad or Others? - suitability

Still exploring Github... will it be the best we can have?

missing a little bit the email-notifications of changes Launchpad provides

### Automated install

Unless we run an installer, questioning the user and
providing defaults, should request at least one
variable set: `pdee-install-dir' - without that some
larger trouble is ahead.
